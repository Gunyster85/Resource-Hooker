<h2>About:</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: medium;">So guys welcome to the very first easy and noob free resource hacker. It's Resource Hooker which will help you to do stuff with your windows PE file.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: medium;">You can add, change, replace resource, icons, bitmaps and many more with easy and friendly GUI editor. Very special thanks to Kolby (Plexdata) who start this project and made a basic Resource Viewer, so I found it's a very good project and should get further more development that's why continued this project and made a complete Resource Hooker with it. Now you can do whatever you want with any PE file.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">So pack your seats and let's go to the journey of my project, sorry I mean our project</span></p>
